## This is an experiment

## Why

Responding to climate change requires radical rethinking of our energy systems. But what should these changes look like – in politics, in economics and in our lives?

Movements globally are developing visions and solutions for a fairer energy future. A First Nation community in Alberta is installing solar panels while resisting tar sands extraction. The residents of a housing estate in London are rejecting an enforced switch to more expensive, privatised heating. The National Union of Metalworkers in South Africa is working out a just transition strategy. German cities are re-municipalising energy supply.

We know there’s no one answer. Focusing solely on small-scale renewable energy projects  won’t provide the scale of transformation needed and doesn’t redistribute political power. Yet large-scale renewables – like Desertec in the Sahara or proposed mega-dams in the Cordillera region of the Philippines – can become tools of colonial or extractivist exploitation.

In struggles about energy, trade unions, frontline communities, and democratic energy enterprises are also sites of knowledge.

We are running a pilot online peer learning course to

* Pool some of this expertise
* Bring people together from different sectors and places
* Share and develop experience, analysis and visions
* Foreground Global South and marginalised perspectives.

We know designing a creative, participatory community can be tricky. We're here to help
you **craft assignments** that rule, **build an audience** and support you along the way. You'll
even learn a few technical skills in the process. Don't worry, 1s and 0s wash off
pretty easily.
		
## OK, but who are you guys?

We're [Peer 2 Peer University](http://p2pu.org)--we build learning communities
on the web. In the last 5 years, we put together courses like 
[Play With Your Music](http://www.playwithyourmusic.org/),
[Learning Creative Learning](http://learn.media.mit.edu/lcl/), the
[Deeper Learning MOOC](http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/), and
[A Gentle Intro to Python](http://mechanicalmooc.org/). 
Also, we're a non-profit and a distributed team (so we use the tools we recommend).
