## Create a Learning Community that Lasts

Research 101 is an interactive online tutorial for students wanting an introduction to cool and useful research and library skills to succeed and have fun in college. The tutorial covers the basics, including how to select a topic and develop research questions, as well as how to select, search for, find, and evaluate information sources.

Inspired by UW's librarians(http://faculty.washington.edu/jwholmes/research101/)Research 101 is intended to help improve how you research, so you can tackle information problems anywhere. Research 101 is NOT intended to replace meetings with your instructor or librarians.
