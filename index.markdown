## Start with your Passions

The most successful research projects begin with a topic you're passionate about, and develop into a collection of research questions you're driven to answer and explore. In this course we'll help you turn your passions into questions, and then uncover the conversations researchers, scholars, and thinkers are having on your topic. From there, we'll equip you with the tools to explore diverse perspectives on your topic, keep your research organized, and start researching, reading, and writing your way in to the conversation.
