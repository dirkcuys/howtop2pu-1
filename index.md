## Summary of internship
This cohort of the Tech Lab will learn about networks and how data travels, both from a technical perspective, and from a civic and political perspective. The 3-month session will be organized around three projects, and will give young people to opportunity to develop marketable skills in web development and wireless networks, to create media to teach an intergenerational audience about data and privacy issues, and to build their own internet/mesh wireless network along Belmont Avenue. Additionally, students will leave with the skills to be lifelong learners by using library resources, online resources, and cooperative learning networks.

## Why this is important

It can often feel like we have little control over our personal information, and by extension, our lives. Using the internet, or just existing in a connected world with sensors and monitoring technologies enables surveillance by law enforcement, parents, peers, and schools, can affect access to opportunities and resources, and can expose us in ways we never asked for. We want learners to build an understanding of how to personally control what information is transmitted, but also why and how governments, corporations, and nonprofit institutions use and control our data and communication tools, and how to make change in these systems (and how to build our own alternatives). 

## Why the Brooklyn Public Library is Doing This
Brooklyn Public Library (BPL) is an anchor institution that plays a crucial role as a community connector and hopes to deepen its cohort-based work readiness services. A community-driven wireless network and a technology-based fellowship program for young adults, ages 18-24, will serve up to 45 young people annually and will teach technology, leadership and workplace readiness skills. Fellows will install and maintain the wireless network, while engaging community members – residents, community-based organizations and small businesses – in using the free broadband access.
