				<h2>Build something cool to show your friends.</h2>

				<p>Everywhere there are people telling you that you should be learning to code. But you're not sure. It sounds a lot like being a glorified typist. You have a friend, they go on about code, but all you see is a bunch of boring symbols on a screen :(</p>

				<p>But you like the idea of being able to make something. You like solving complex problems. You like having something cool to show your friends. And most of all, you like being able to tell a computer how to do work you don't want to!</p>

				<p>That is why you should build your own city in JavaScript. At the end you will have a better idea what is involved when writing a program and if you like it or not. And more importantly, you'll have your own city that you can show off to your friends1</p>
