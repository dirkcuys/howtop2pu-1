The main drivers are [Doug Belshaw](http://twitter.com/dajbelshaw) and [Bryan Mathers](http://twitter.com/BryanMMathers) as part of the work they're doing with the <a href="http://thinkoutloudclub.com">Think Out Loud Club</a> for <a href="http://cityandguilds.com">City & Guilds</a>. It's all being developed in the open (and openly-licensed) so you're very much encouraged to get involved!
