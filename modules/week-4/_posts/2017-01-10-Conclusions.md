# Conclusions

This week we finished up our exploration of Structural Markup by look at lists.

You were then introduced and subsequently asked to read about all of the various elements used for semantic markup.

In addition, you should feel comfortable with hyperlinks, both within a single site, and to external sites.

Finally, you were presented with information for how to look at other peoples code, ask questions, and look at websites from “wayyyyy back”.

You will be asked to show competence with all of these skills in this [weeks homework, which you can of course find in the course repo wiki on GitHub.com](https://github.com/Montana-Media-Arts/341-work/wiki/Week-4-HW).
