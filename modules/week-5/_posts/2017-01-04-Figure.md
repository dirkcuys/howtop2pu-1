# Figure & Figure Caption

With HTML5, a couple new elements were introduced to further assist with images. These are “figure” (`<figure>`) and “figure caption” (`<figcaption>`). These can be used together to easily group figures or images with associated captions.

The figure element is used as a container to group together one or more images with a caption. Within the figure element, you would place your img or related elements.

Within this figure element you will also place your caption elements.

```html
<figure>
    <img src="imgs/chihuahua.jpg" alt="Picture of a cute Chihuahua in a teacup" title="Chihuahua in a Teacup" width="640" height="426">
    <br />
    <figcaption>An adorably cute chihuahua in a teacup!</figcaption>
</figure>
```
<div class="displayed_code_example">
<figure align="center">
    <img src="../imgs/chihuahua.jpg" alt="Picture of a cute Chihuahua in a teacup" title="Chihuahua in a Teacup" width="640" height="426" align="center" style="margin:auto!important;">
    <br />
    <figcaption align="center">An adorably cute chihuahua in a teacup!</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
