# The Textarea Element

The `textarea` input type can be used to create an input field element where users can enter longer responses.

**NOTE:** This field uses an opening and closing tag pair. Any text between these tags will initially inhabit the box.


## Additional Optional Attributes

### cols & rows

You can specify the number of `cols` and `rows` through the appropriate attributes. This changes the size of the displayed element, as well as how text will look when typed.

- `cols`; this is the width of the textarea in character widths (i.e. this is the number of characters that will fit from left to right).
- `rows`; this is the number of visible lines.

NOTE: Typically, and as is the case with many size parameters that you can set in HTML, you should override these parameters with CSS. See the following code example.


```html
<form action="http://www.example.com/comments.php">
    <h2>Type a long story:</h2>
    <textarea name="comments" cols="20" rows="4" style="min-width:100%">
    Enter your comments...
    </textarea>
</form>
```

<div class="displayed_code_example">
    <form action="http://www.example.com/comments.php">
    <h2>Type a long story:</h2>
    <textarea name="comments" cols="20" rows="8" style="min-width:100%">Once upon a time, there was a happy professor...</textarea>
    </form>
</div>
