# BklynConnect Open Curriculum

This will be the open, online curriculum for BklynConnect, a cohort-based, project-driven course in wireless networking, digital privacy, and designing for consentfulness. 

The course is still in progress, and currently the curriculum lives in [a living Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sZLhq8VYMmUQGTuuZ0I7k-LEnMXuVUUwcUOOeXRQPus/edit?usp=sharing), but the hope is to port it to a simple to navigate website, and to incorporate ways for anyone to remix the curriculum for their own needs.

Right now, the larger project lives at [https://github.com/mayawagon/bklynCONNECT](https://github.com/mayawagon/bklynCONNECT) and the course website repo is at [https://github.com/mayawagon/datamoves](https://github.com/mayawagon/datamoves). These need to be combined or linked in some way. 

## How do I see where the site is right now?

Go to [https://mayawagon.github.io/course-in-a-box/](https://mayawagon.github.io/course-in-a-box/). Soon we'll get a new name for the repository, and domain name. 

## What template are you using?

This course was created using the [Jekyll Course template from P2PU](http://github.com/p2pu/jekyll-course-template), using their guide for how to create an online course: [howto.p2pu.org](http://howto.p2pu.org).
